# Important information.
<p> Each folder in the root directory <span color="red">("IT2FinalFolder/")</span>, represents a collection of projects that are mad with similar stacks. Below is information regarding each folder and their stacks. </p>

### ExpressServers/
- This folder contains projects that were made using the express.js routing package for node.js. So, in order to run projects in this folder, you will need to have node.js installed and ```cd``` into the project directory that you want to run. Then run the ```node main.js```. The main file might vary depending on which project you are on, sometimes it might be ```server.js```, and other times, it might be ```index.js```. So change the command to match the project's main file.

### Extensions/
- This folder contains one or two extensions i've worked on during this year's semester. In order to run these extensions, you will need to first upload the code to google, and then visit the site that the extension is made for. 
- In order to add an extension to chrome, just visit chrome://extensions on your google browser. Then click "load unpacked" and select the extension folder.
- PS: Make sure that these extensions are ran chrome because they might not work on other browsers.
