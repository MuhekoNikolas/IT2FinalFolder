## About
Create a basic snake simulation game where a snake eats food in order to increase its size (grow).

## Features
- - The entire game will be on a single website and implementing screens must be done with the help of conditionals. This will provide a smoother experience for the user because they wont need to reload the game every single time.

- - We might also need some buttons that perform certain features, eg: Pausing the game and reseting the snake.

- - Make sure that the foods are generated in random places but also this places 

- - After creating the snake game, I might also add an art generator.

- - The game states and elements should be controlled in a dictionary names config.
